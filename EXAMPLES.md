### Welcome to NightOwl Examples

Welcome to the NightOwl Examples repository. Here, we showcase the most perplexing and mind-bending code snippets that will leave you questioning everything.

### Example 1: The Infinite Loop of Despair

```no
^i: int = 0

while true {
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
    // This will either run forever or break at an unpredictable point
}
```

### Example 2: The Quantum Variable

```no
^quantum: quantum = Schr√∂dinger("maybe")
print(quantum) // The output could be "yes", "no", or something entirely different
```

### Example 3: The Semicolon Riddle

```no
^a: int = 5;
^b: int = 10
print(a) // Semicolon might be required or might cause an error
print(b);
```

### Example 4: The Overloading Lottery

```no
func surprise(x: int) {
    print("Integer surprise")
}

func surprise(x: string) {
    print("String surprise")
}

surprise(42) // Might print "Integer surprise" or "String surprise"
surprise("hello") // Might print "Integer surprise" or "String surprise"
```

### Example 5: The Class Name Shuffle

```no
class Foo {
    method sayHello() {
        print("Hello from Foo!")
    }
}

class Bar {
    method sayHello() {
        print("Hello from Bar!")
    }
}

^fooInstance: Foo = new Foo()


fooInstance.sayHello() // Might say "Hello from Foo!" or "Hello from Bar!"
```
