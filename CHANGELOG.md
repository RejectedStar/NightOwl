### NightOwl Changelog

Welcome to the changelog for NightOwl! This file is where we document all the changes that will make you question the very fabric of reality.

### [Unreleased] - 2024-08-15

- **Added**: New `glorp` keyword. It does nothing. Enjoy the confusion.
- **Changed**: The behavior of `=` operator to be randomly either assignment or comparison.
- **Deprecated**: The concept of stable variables. All variables are now unpredictably mutable.

### [0.1.0] - 2024-07-01

- **Initial Release**: Introduced the `NightOwl` language. Expected to break every rule of programming and sanity.

### [0.1.1] - 2024-07-15

- **Fixed**: Nothing. We don’t do fixes in NightOwl. Embrace the brokenness.
- **Improved**: Syntax for `delete` keyword to make it even more ambiguous.

### [0.1.2] - 2024-08-01

- **Updated**: `async` functions might now run asynchronously or synchronously based on the phase of the moon.
- **Removed**: The concept of predictable behavior. It’s all random now.

### [0.1.3] - 2024-08-10

- **Added**: Support for a new error type, `cosmicError`. It’s an error that only occurs when you least expect it.

### [0.1.4] - 2024-08-15

- **Improved**: Documentation to include more cryptic instructions and confusing examples.

### Future Releases

Future releases will continue to enhance the chaotic nature of NightOwl. Expect more features that defy explanation and contribute to the ongoing joke that is NightOwl.
